# Create.run

Create.run is an opinionated, minimalistic modpack centered around complex and interesting automation.

## Core values
* Complex and unique automation
* Radical simplifcation, No clutter. Every item and block has a reason to be in the game.
* Lower amount of tasks that aren't "making cool stuff"
* Lightweight
* Documentation
* Customization - we have a clear gameplay loop we try to inforce, but if there is something that doesn't fit, you should be able to change it easily.


## Complex and unique automation:
* Create - A core part of the pack, the uniqeue logistics and processes of the mod allow us to explore new teretory in problem solving and creative automation*1
* Botania - Another core element of the run epxeriance.
* Pneumaticraft - This mod has a lot of interesting systems to build on
* Quark + oddities
* Supplementaries


## Lower amount of tasks that aren't "making cool stuff"
* Effortless building - with the configs that allow you to build and destroy huge things right out of the gate.
* Ore excavator - trees and veins are quickly dealt with
* Tom's Simple Storage Mod - without any automation parts, it is just a fancy way to access your storage to make your life easier without taking away from any of the cool automation


## Precise items, No clutter. Every item has a reason to be in the game.
* Less random materials and ingots with one use, we make sure to reduce the amount of items as much as possible while deligating complexity to other parts of the chain


## Lightweight
* The pack has around 50 mods

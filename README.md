Create.run is an opinionated, minimalistic modpack centered around complex and interesting automation.

    A small but ambitious project to give create the stage it deserves
## About the project
### Core values
<details>
  <summary>Complex and unique automation</summary>
  
Using Create and Botanias natural automation focus as a loose base, we are constructing processing lines with depth and options.
* Create - A core part of the pack, the unique logistics and processes of the mod allow us to explore new territory in problem solving and creative automation*1
* Botania - Another core element of the run experience.
* Quark + oddities
* Supplementaries
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Radical simplification</summary>
  
    No clutter. Every item and block has ~~a reason~~ at least a few reasons to be in the game.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Low amount of tasks that aren't "making cool stuff"</summary>
  
* Effortless building - with the configs that allow you to build and destroy huge things right out of the gate.
* Ore excavator - trees and veins are quickly dealt with
* Refined Storage - without any automation parts, it is just a fancy way to access your storage to make your life easier without taking away any of the cool automation
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Lightweight</summary>
  
The pack has around 60 mods, takes less than a minute to boot!
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Heavily Documented, in game</summary>
  
    
</details>
<details>
  <summary>A new take on progression</summary>
  
Consistency and fun, sense based processes over realistic ones
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Customization</summary>
  
we have a clear gameplay loop we try to enforce, but if there is something that doesn't fit, you should be able to change it easily.

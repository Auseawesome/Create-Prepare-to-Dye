# Create.run

Create.run is an opinionated, minimalistic modpack centered around complex and interesting automation.

    A small but ambitious project to give create the stage it deserves
## Core values
* Complex and unique automation
* Radical simplification, No clutter. Every item and block has ~~a reason~~ at least a few reasons to be in the game.
* Low amount of tasks that aren't "making cool stuff"
* Lightweight
* Heavily Documented, in game
* Consistency and fun, sense based processes over realistic ones
* Customization - we have a clear gameplay loop we try to enforce, but if there is something that doesn't fit, you should be able to change it easily.


## Complex and unique automation:
Using Create and Botanias natural automation focus as a loose base, we are constructing processing lines with depth and options.
* Create - A core part of the pack, the unique logistics and processes of the mod allow us to explore new territory in problem solving and creative automation*1
* Botania - Another core element of the run experience.
* Quark + oddities
* Supplementaries


## Lower amount of tasks that aren't "making cool stuff"
* Effortless building - with the configs that allow you to build and destroy huge things right out of the gate.
* Ore excavator - trees and veins are quickly dealt with
* Refined Storage - without any automation parts, it is just a fancy way to access your storage to make your life easier without taking away any of the cool automation


## Radical simplification
* Less random materials and ingots with one use, we make sure to reduce the amount of items as much as possible while delegating complexity to other parts of the chain.


## Lightweight
* The pack has around 60 mods

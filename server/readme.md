# Server files
## To start the server for the first time, either 
- put `mods, config, kubejs, defaultconfigs` in the server folder
- just run the script `start-or-generate-server` and it will do it for you assuming your game folder is a above this one
- read the EULA and accept it, via the `eula.txt` file. Very important stuff
- run the same script

## To start the server after the first time
- run the script `start-or-generate-server`

## To update the server
- delete the `mods, config, kubejs, defaultconfigs` folders and repeat the steps of starting the server for the first time
